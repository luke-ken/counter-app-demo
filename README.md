# A counter demo app

## 1. Requirements

- A counter app with React and Redux, where the state is kept in Redux
- The same app, but the counting is done on a nodejs backend via a JSON-RPC API over HTTP
- The same app again, but uses WebSocket instead of HTTP to communicate with backend
- The whole app should be styled with TailwindCSS
